        <i>
            I've always been fond of video games. Here's a&nbsp;small tribute to
            the game many of us enjoyed as kids.

    <p>
        Maneuver the snake around the screen to consume food, while avoiding
        collisions with the screen edges and the snake's own body.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Controls:</b> use ←, ↑, →, ↓ keyboard buttons or swipe gestures to maneuver
        the snake.
