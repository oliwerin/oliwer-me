When I joined Contractbook almost 3.5 years ago, I made a promise to myself to use the job change as an opportunity to solidify my backend knowledge. My motivation was to become a more well-rounded developer, and leave my technical comfort zone.

My MS in Computer Science gave me a good foundation to explore any technical direction, and I had been working on some backend projects on my own. However, it was never consistent, as I had been focused on the frontend for most of my career.

Elixir is a functional language built on top of Erlang, and Phoenix is its most popular web application framework. I chose it because I had positive experiences with functional programming and wanted to explore it further. I knew that most programmers who use this language really like it, and most importantly, I found a perfect job opening. My current employer was open to hiring me as a fullstack developer with the prospect of me catching up with Elixir. Due to the language being relatively niche, companies adopting it often use this approach.

## The learning process

My approach was to familiarize myself with the syntax and core concepts first. I started by reading the official Elixir getting started guide and experimenting with the interactive console along the way. To reinforce what I was learning, I completed a few exercises on the Exercism platform. This gave me the confidence to start reading the code in the repository and write simple commands without constantly checking the documentation.

Then I picked up my first task, which was simple: compute a value and expose it  to the UI. The complexity of the tasks I was assigned gradually increased, allowing me to learn the entire API flow, both reading from and writing to the database. This process helped me understand how the repository is structured and where specific pieces of logic belong.

The learning curve was steep at first, mainly because the language introduced several concepts that were new to me, such as pattern-matching, with/case/cond statements, atoms, and others. These concepts are understandable on their own, but combined, they initially made my brain work hard. However, as with most learning, it was a matter of repetition. Each time I encountered these concepts, they became more familiar until I reached the point where I could use them easily and with good awareness.

After becoming familiar with the language, it all of a sudden became to feel easy, almost like a breeze. I was eagerily looking for more backend tasks because it felt satifying to complete them.

I should emphasize that while I was able to juggle both frontend and backend tasks, there were times when I had to focus more on one of them. This was either due to the nature of the project I was working on or the preferences and capacity of other developers on the team. Therefore, there were times when I had to pause my Elixir learning and return to it later.

While I now feel confident in Elixir, I hesitate to consider myself an expert just yet. I haven't delved into more advanced language concepts like meta programming, and I feel I have room to improve in understanding server infrastructure. However, I am fluent in writing most new features and debugging issues.
